## Introduction
The Enhanced Hash Security System is a cryptographic solution designed to enhance the security of hash functions against future vulnerabilities arising from advancements in computational power, such as quantum computing. This system utilizes a sequence of two hashes, reducing the size of the initial hash and incorporating diverse hash technologies. This repository contains the system's whitepaper, providing an in-depth overview and example of use.
